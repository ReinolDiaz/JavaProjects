A collection of java projects as listed below

1)  ReinolDiaz/JavaProjects/BinarySearchTreeDictionary

    - A program that accepts words and their meanings

    - Displays the list of words in alphabetical order   

    - When an entry is to be added to the dictionary you must first enter the word as one string

    - Then enter the meaning as separate string. 

    - A word may have multiple meanings, and may be entered at separate times 
        - When this occurs, place each successive meaning on a separate line. 

    - This new meaning must be preceded  by  a  dash.  For  example,  if  you  enter  the  following  words  and  with  their meanings in the following order: 
        Library, School, Cup, and School, then your output should be a display as shown below. Another requirement 

        Cup – a container from which we drink.
        Library – a collection of books
        School – a place of learning

    - From time-to-time words become obsolete. When this happens, that word must be removed from the dictionary
